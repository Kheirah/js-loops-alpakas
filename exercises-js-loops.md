## For Loops

1. Write a `for` loop that logs the numbers from `1` to `10` to the console.

2. Write a `for` loop that logs the even numbers from `2` to `10` to the console.

3. Write a `for` loop that logs the numbers from `10` to `1` to the console.

4. Write a `for` loop that logs the numbers from `1` to `100` to the console, but logs

- "Fizz" instead of the number if it is divisible by `3`,
- "Buzz" instead of the number if it is divisible by `5`, and
- "FizzBuzz" instead of the number if it is divisible by both `3` and `5`.

5. Write a `for` loop that logs the sum of the numbers from `1` to `10` to the console.

6. Write a `for` loop that logs the factorial of a given number `n` to the console. The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n`.

7. Write a `for` loop that logs the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number `n` to the console. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
